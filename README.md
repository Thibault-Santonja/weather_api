Build a command line API client
===


Using the Metaweather API, make a command line tool that receives a city name as an
argument and says whether it’s going to rain tomorrow in this city or not. Here again,
packaging and tests are optional (but always appreciated). This can be done quite
shortly if you’re on a schedule and stick to the minimum.
